## Mysql Text Table Load-In Scripts  

the shell scripts in this folder are designed to load downloaded text table files into a user's own mysql database using a connection specified in the sql.conf file (template provided).  
the user must substitute in their own file path for the downloaded tsv files, and may need to change the year suffix for the file.
